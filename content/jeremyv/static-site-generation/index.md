I'm currently interested in generating my website using a static site generator, in particular, Gatsby.js.

## Advantages of using static site rendering (SSR)

- Easy to deploy
- No security footprint - I don't have to manage servers, databases, or worry about deploying patches because there's nothing to comprise
- It can generate a whole website from Markdown content. I have written all my notes in Markdown format using text files for years, and I've recently switched over to using Obsidian as my personal knowledge management system.
